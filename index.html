                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>I grew up in the small town of Mount Pleasant, Utah. 
                            My passion for computers developed during my childhood when I played the video game "Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon." 
                            The virtual world has always fascinated me. In my leisure time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, listening to music, and spending quality time with my close friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been working as a software engineer at Clozd for the past two years. 
                            During my time, I have architected, developed, and maintained several feature improvements across our platform. 
                            Some of the projects I have worked on include a fully functional drag-and-drop report builder, 
                            the implementation of commenting and mentioning in a transcript to enhance customer engagement, 
                            and the integration of a Slack App to notify users of newly published information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I previously worked as a full-stack developer, website designer and technical support at
                            Etrafficers, Inc. for four years. During my time at
                            Etrafficers, I developed, deployed and maintained over 30 mortgage website templates
                            and 75
                            mortgage company websites (<a

                                style="text-decoration: underline;">See some examples</a>). I worked closely with
                            clients customizing their websites to fit their needs.
                            I also built a new dashboard for loan officers to view loan applications and 
                            a website editor for clients to make their own changes to their websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I studied Computer Science with an emphasis in Full-Stack Development at Utah Valley University. 
                            I graduated from the Honors Program with a GPA of 3.9.

                            I was contracted to develop, deploy, and maintain a web application entirely from scratch. 
                            This project utilizes React, Node.js (with Typescript), and the Prisma ORM. 
                            The application is deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IAC) through Pulumi. 
                            Currently in beta, the project is set to launch in Fall 2023 and is not yet available to users.

                            vanilla JS. I used the ES6 classes and my own custom CSS. It can even be built as an

                        <h3>Minesweeper</h3>
                        <p>I've always been interested in game development, mostly due to my love for games. I
                            built a clone of the classic Minesweeper game. It's built in vanilla JS using the ES6
                            classes and HTML canvas to display the game. I learned more about the HTML canvas while
                            creating this game.
                            Give it a try!</p>
