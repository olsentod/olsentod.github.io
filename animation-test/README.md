# AnimationTest
I built a JS game character controller with some animations.


## Starting program
The best way to run this program is to run it through VSCode's Live Server extension. I didn't really know the best way around the CORS policy, so running it on a live dev server works just fine.

Initialize the live server on index.html and have fun!
